# Event Registration Form

## Project Overview
This project is a simple yet functional Event Registration Form created using plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The form collects user information required to register for a fictional event, including name, email, phone number, event date, and the number of tickets. Input validation is performed using regular expressions (regex) to ensure that the user provides correctly formatted information.

## Features
- `Name Field`: Accepts only letters and spaces.
- `Email Field`: Requires a valid email format (e.g., someone@domain.com).
- `Phone Number Field`: Requires a phone number in the format (123) 456-7890.
- `Event Date Field`: Requires a valid date in MM/DD/YYYY format.
- `Number of Tickets Field`: Accepts a number between 1 and 10.
